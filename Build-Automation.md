+ [Watcher](https://github.com/splitbrain/Watcher) :: A daemon that watches specified files/folders for changes and fires commands in response to those changes. It is similar to incron, however, configuration uses a simpler to read `ini` file instead of a plain text file. Unlike incron it can also recursively monitor directories. It's also written in Python, making it easier to hack.
